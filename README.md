# Patent Pull
This is a project purely for fun and made out of curiosity.
Project Scrapes data and displays information about a patent

Consideration:
1. Expand data structure:
    - Consider scraping patent data from multiple sources (e.g., different patent offices, databases, or APIs). This will demonstrate your ability to work with diverse data.
    - explore other patent-related websites or APIs beyond Google Patents.

2. Advanced Features:
    - Keyword Search: Allow users to search for patents related to specific keywords or technologies.
    - Advanced Filters: Enable filtering by patent type (utility, design, plant), filing date, inventor, assignee, etc.
    - Graphical Visualization: Create visualizations (e.g., graphs, charts) based on patent data trends.

3. Machine Learning:
    - Train ML models to predict patent success (e.g., granted vs. rejected) based on features like inventors, assignees, or keywords.
    - Explore ML-based clustering or topic modeling for patent categorization.

4. User Friendly Interface:
    - Build a user-friendly web interface where users can input search queries, view patent details, and explore visualizations.
    - Consider using a front-end framework (e.g., React, Vue.js) to enhance the user experience.

5. Make a interactive website interface that the users can interact with. We will scrap the javafx idea as I feel like hosting this program on a website
    will make alot more sense as the whole project is a browser based application. We are using browser simulation along with webscraping so might as well kepp the 
    information this program makes on the web too.
    
5. Write Documentation:
    - write clear documentation including installation instruction and usage guidelines
    - set up test to validate functionality
