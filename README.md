# Patent Pull

Project Scrapes data and displays information about a patent

Consideration:
1. Expand data structure:
    - Consider scraping patent data from multiple sources (e.g., different patent offices, databases, or APIs). This will demonstrate your ability to work with diverse data.
    - explore other patent-related websites or APIs beyond Google Patents.

2. Advanced Features:
    - Keyword Search: Allow users to search for patents related to specific keywords or technologies.
    - Advanced Filters: Enable filtering by patent type (utility, design, plant), filing date, inventor, assignee, etc.
    - Graphical Visualization: Create visualizations (e.g., graphs, charts) based on patent data trends.

3. Make a interactive website interface that the users can interact with. We will scrap the javafx idea as I feel like hosting this program on a website
    will make alot more sense as the whole project is a browser based application. We are using browser simulation along with webscraping so might as well kepp the 
    information this program makes on the web too.
    
4. Write Documentation:
    - write clear documentation including installation instruction and usage guidelines
    - set up test to validate functionality
